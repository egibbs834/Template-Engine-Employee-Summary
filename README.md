# Template Engine - Employee Summary

## Description
This application uses a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. The application will prompt the user to add three types of employees: mananagers, engineers, and interns. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
